# multiplayer-hc
A Fabric port of a PaperMC plugin made by Hoi_A. This is a minigame where players are transported to a Minecraft world with the goal of defeating the Ender Dragon. However, if one of them dies, then they all die and the world is lost! This version of the minigame adds random events which occur throughout the course of the game. 

You can find the original plugin at https://github.com/Hoi15A/multiplayer-hc.
